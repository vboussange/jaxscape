    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial ecological data often arrives as large continuous rasters that exceed computational memory or would benefit from localized processing. Moving window operations—systematically dividing a raster into overlapping tiles—provide an elegant solution for both computational tractability and ecological interpretability. Rather than processing an entire landscape at once, moving windows allow us to compute metrics locally, capturing spatial heterogeneity while managing memory constraints through sequential or parallel processing of manageable chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "JAXScape's `WindowOperation` class offers flexible tools for iterating over raster windows with configurable buffer zones that handle edge effects gracefully. Whether computing local connectivity metrics, applying spatially-varying transformations, or parallelizing expensive distance calculations across a large landscape, moving windows transform intractable problems into sequences of tractable sub-problems. This notebook demonstrates both lazy iteration (processing one window at a time for memory efficiency) and eager iteration (loading all windows into memory for GPU-accelerated batch processing), along with techniques for seamlessly reassembling processed tiles back into coherent landscape-scale outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "Moving window operations require three key parameters. The **window size** determines the dimensions of each tile or focal region we'll process—larger windows capture more spatial context but increase computational cost. The **buffer size** defines an overlap zone around each window's core area, which is essential for handling edge effects in operations like distance calculations or convolutions where pixels near boundaries need information from neighboring regions. Finally, **padding** extends the original raster with boundary values to ensure windows near edges have complete neighborhoods.\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving Window Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving window operations provide a systematic framework for processing large rasters by dividing them into manageable, overlapping tiles. The **buffer zones** are critical for maintaining spatial continuity—they provide necessary context for edge pixels but are excluded when assembling final results. **Padding** the original raster ensures windows near boundaries have complete neighborhoods, preventing edge artifacts in downstream analyses. The choice between lazy and eager iteration depends on the balance between memory constraints and computational parallelism: lazy iteration conserves memory by processing one window at a time, while eager iteration enables GPU-accelerated batch processing through vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is essential for **large-scale connectivity analysis**, where computing all-pairs distances for millions of pixels would exhaust memory, but dividing the landscape into windows makes the problem tractable. It supports **parallel computation** by distributing independent windows across multiple processors or devices, with JAX's `vmap` providing seamless vectorization. The technique enables **focal operations** that depend on local neighborhoods, such as moving averages, edge detection, or local connectivity metrics. It also facilitates **progressive processing** where results from one window inform calculations in adjacent windows, enabling iterative refinement of landscape-scale metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Several practical factors affect performance and accuracy. **Window size** should match the spatial scale of ecological processes—too small and you lose context, too large and computation becomes prohibitive. **Buffer size** must accommodate the maximum distance or neighborhood size in your operations, typically set to the dispersal distance or kernel radius. **Overlap handling** requires careful attention when reassembling results: the `update_raster_with_focal_window` method manages this automatically by only writing core regions, but custom pipelines need explicit edge coordination. **Memory-computation trade-offs** are central: eager iteration's memory cost grows linearly with window count, but enables orders-of-magnitude speedups through parallelism on modern accelerators.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions and Advanced Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic moving window framework can be extended in several directions. **Adaptive window sizing** could vary window dimensions based on local landscape heterogeneity or data density, allocating computational resources where they're most needed. **Multi-scale analysis** might process the same landscape at different window sizes to capture phenomena operating at multiple spatial scales simultaneously. **Streaming workflows** could combine lazy iteration with progressive disk writes to process rasters larger than available RAM. **Hierarchical tiling** might use coarse windows to identify regions of interest, then apply fine-grained windows only where needed, optimizing the computation-accuracy trade-off for large-scale applications."
